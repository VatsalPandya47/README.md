## 🧑‍💻 About Me
I’m a builder at heart. I love turning ideas into products that solve real problems.  
Right now, I’m leading **TasksMind**, where we’re building your **AI Chief of Staff** — software that listens to meetings, extracts tasks in real-time, and keeps teams aligned without the manual overhead.  

But this is just the beginning. The vision is **personalized AGI agents** that:  
- Join your meetings automatically  
- Remember context across conversations  
- Execute tasks on your behalf  
- Adapt to the way *you* work  

From Nebraska → Silicon Valley → the world 🌎

### 🌟 Next Step: AGI for Work  
We’re evolving TasksMind into **autonomous agents** that can:
